    "# Workbook 3: Informed Search Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "Overview of activities and objectives of this workbook:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first part of this workbook will apply the Depth-first and Breadth-first algorithms you created last week to a new problem - navigating a maze (**If you have not done worksheet 2, go back and do that first**).\n",
    "    - A maze is a simple and easy-to-visualise optimisation problem to illustrate the properties of different search algorithms.\n",
    "    - A maze has a starting position and the desired endpoint (goal), so we need to find a sequence of inputs that takes us from the start to the goal in as few moves as possible.\n",
    "    - A maze can be modelled like a graph, just like fox-chicken-grain and the combination lock.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The second part of this workbook will implement the Best-first and A-Star search algorithms.\n",
    "    - We will do this in a similar way as Depth-first and Breadth-first, by overriding the `select_and_move_from_openlist()` function of the `SingleMemberSearch` class.\n",
    "    - Depth-first and Breadth-first are both **uninformed** search algorithms, which means they do not consider the *quality* of a candidate solution.\n",
    "    - Best-first and A-Star are both **informed** search algorithms, which means they do consider the *quality* of a candidate solution.\n",
    "    - In the case of a maze, the quality could simply be the distance the candidate solution is to the goal (Best-first), or the number of moves so far + the distance the candidate solution is to the goal (A-Star).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The third part of this workbook will test your understanding of these algorithms and compare their behaviour.\n",
    "    - And give you experience of evaluating the efficiency of an algorithm for a problem (in this case path-planning) by creating different instances of a problem (mazes) to *stress-test* different methods."

    "As discussed in the lectures, we consider a general generate-and-test framework for search that can be easily adapted to provide algorithms with different behaviours and applied to many different problems.\n",

    "  - **SingleMemberSearch**\n",
    "  - **Problem**\n",
    "  - **CandidateSolution**\n",
    "2. Created your own search subclasses **DepthfirstSearch** and **BreadthFirstSearch** by over-riding the function **select_and_move_from_openlist()**\n",
    "3. Applied those algorithms to two subclasses of problem: **CombinationLock** and **FoxChickenGrain**\n",
    "\n",
    "This Week you can apply those algorithms to the problem of solving a maze.\n",
    "Run the following cells:\n",
    "1. The first ones import the maze and other libraries we need\n",
